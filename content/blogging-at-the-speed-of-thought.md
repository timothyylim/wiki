# Blogging At The Speed of Thought 

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my writing tool. It's incredibly snappy and allows me to focus on my words instead of dealing with navigating a lot of interfaces.

I am incredibly fast because I can just create a new file by pressing `CMD + o` then typing out the file name. In this case, I just typed `CMD + o` then `wiki/blogging-at-the-speed-of-thought` which creates a new file in my `wiki` folder.

I then just write this post.

Not only that, Obsidian supports [vim](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim) keybindings which means I can move around my text super quickly. 

When I'm done, I have a command set up where I run `wiki-push` which does some work behind the scenes to update my Github where this blog is hosted. 

If you want more technical details on how this setup works have a look at this [article](/editing-a-static-site-with-obsidian).
