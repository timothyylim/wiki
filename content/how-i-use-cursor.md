# How I Use Cursor 

[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) is an AI powered Code Editor and although it is a fork of VSCode it differs greatly from it in being designed intentionally around AI workflows.

The biggest problem I had with ChatGPT was copying and pasting the context for my programming problem. Cursor solves this by actually being aware of your entire codebase which means it can also offer suggestions across multiple files.

I use three different commands:
- `CMD+k` - I highlight some code and press this for surgical suggestions
- `CMD+i` - this brings up a popup window from which I can prompt, this allows me to still keep the code I'm working on in my field of vision 
- `CMD+l`- this opens a sidebar where I can have longer ranging dialogues with the AI

You can also press `CMD+Enter` to accept changes.
