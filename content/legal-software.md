# Some thoughts on automating legal processes 

 - A big inspiration is [Plymouth Street](http://plymouthstreet.com) which is the best in class legal firm for handling immigration to the US, specifically o1 
 - They target tech workers who have both money and an appreciation for good processes 
 - Have a look at their dashboard, see how th something as opaque as an immigration process can give clients transparency and then a feeling of security 
 - Too many legal processes require a lot of back and forth in deep email chains where things are lost 
 - Software for legal firms already exist (https://www.mycase.com) but perhaps there is a play for jurisdiction specific automations (i.e. checking the land registry of a specific country) or making custom dashboards for a specific flow like Plymouth does
