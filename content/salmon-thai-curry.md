# salmon thai curry

~ 4 portions 

## Ingredients:

- 4 salmon fillets (frozen works)
- Ginger 
- Garlic 
- Fresh chilli 
- Red thai curry paste
- 1 can (400ml) coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional, for extra umami flavor)
- 1-2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)
- 1 teaspoon sugar or honey (optional, for balance)
- 1 bell pepper, sliced (optional, for extra texture)
- A handful of fresh spinach or bok choy (optional, for greens)
- Steamed jasmine rice, to serve

## Instructions:

1. **Prep the Ingredients**: Start by grating the ginger, mincing the garlic, and slicing the chili. If using fresh salmon, cut it into bite-sized pieces. If you’re using frozen fillets, make sure they’re thawed and cut as well.
    
2. **Cook the Aromatics**: In a large skillet or pot over medium heat, add a bit of oil. Sauté the ginger, garlic, and chili for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Avoid browning them, as you just want to release their flavors.
    
3. **Add Curry Paste**: Stir in the red Thai curry paste and cook for another minute. This will help deepen its flavors.
    
4. **Add Coconut Milk**: Pour in the coconut milk and stir to combine with the paste. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
    
5. **Season the Curry**: Add fish sauce (if using), soy sauce, and a little sugar or honey. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. The curry should have a good balance of salt, heat, and a slight sweetness.
    
6. **Add Vegetables (Optional)**: If you’re adding bell peppers or other vegetables, add them now and cook for about 3-4 minutes until they soften slightly.
    
7. **Add Salmon**: Gently place the salmon pieces into the curry sauce. Simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through. Try not to stir too much to keep the salmon pieces intact.
    
8. **Add Greens (Optional)**: If using spinach or bok choy, add them just before the salmon is done and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the greens are wilted.
    
9. **Serve**: Spoon the curry over steamed jasmine rice. Garnish with fresh cilantro or Thai basil, and serve with lime wedges on the side for a burst of acidity.
