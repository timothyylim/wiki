# Simple Fullstack NextJS build

This is what I usually use as a baseline for my projects:

- NextJS (with the app router)
	- Served via vercel
- Postgres 
	- Served via neondb 
- Prisma ORM 
- NextAuth, I usually use the twitter login 
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) , plain tailwind or MUI for a front end framework 

Might be helpful to read [how to start a nextjs project](./starting-a-nextjs-project) as well.
