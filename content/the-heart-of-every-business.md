# At The Heart of Every Business Is An Email Chain With Too Many PDFs or A Spreadsheet That Only One Person Understands

As far as software has come, millions of dollars still depend on either:
	a. Convoluted email chains that carry destiny defining PDFs 
	b. An elaborate spreadsheet that keeps the entire state of the company

As the cost of programming plummets, it is not possible to build bespoke tools for companies to not have to deal with either of those two things.

A a good piece of software unburdens knowledge workers by holding context for them. Email chains and spreadsheets hold context but they are fragile, they can and should be replaced with custom dasboards that are fun and easy to use.
