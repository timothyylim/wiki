# When To Automate?

Think of software as a railroad. It is infrastructure to do heavy information transport. There are a lot of processes going on in companies, some big some small. 

You want to find out when there's a mismatch between the information being sent and the path it's being sent upon. Lots video sent over emails probably means that a video uploading software should be built. When you see containers being transported on footpaths, it's probably time to lay down the railroad.
